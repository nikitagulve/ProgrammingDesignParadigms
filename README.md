# ProgrammingDesignParadigms: Assignment on Draggable Rectangle

The assignment is to implement a program that displays a selectable, draggable rectangle. The emphasis is on the design recipe which includes data analysis (including template), contract and purpose header, examples, design strategy, code, and tests. 

More detailed problem statement is as below:
-> Your program should start by displaying a solid green rectangle 100 pixels wide and 60 pixels high on a 400 x 300 scene.
-> Depressing the mouse button within the rectangle causes the rectangle to be "selected". This is shown visually by replacing the solid green rectangle by a green outline rectangle. The location of the mouse should be indicated by a solid red circle of radius 5 pixels. Simply pressing the mouse button, without moving the mouse, should not cause the rectangle to move on the canvas.
-> Once the rectangle has been selected, you should be able to drag it around the Universe canvas with the mouse. As you drag it, the position of the mouse within the rectangle (as indicated by the red circle), should not change. When the mouse button is released, the rectangle should go back to its unselected state (solid green) in its new location.
